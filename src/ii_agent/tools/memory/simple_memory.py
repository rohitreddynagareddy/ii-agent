        MEMORY STORAGE GUIDANCE:
        Store information that needs to persist across agent interactions, including:
        - User context: Requirements, goals, preferences, and clarifications
        - Task state: Completed tasks, pending items, current progress
        - Code context: File paths, function signatures, data structures, dependencies
        - Research findings: Key facts, sources, URLs, and reference materials
        - Configuration: Settings, parameters, and environment details
        - Cross-session continuity: Information needed for future interactions
        
        OPERATIONS:
        - Read: Retrieves full memory contents as a string
        - Write: Replaces entire memory (warns when overwriting existing data)
        - Edit: Performs targeted string replacement (warns on multiple matches)
        
        Use structured formats (JSON, YAML, or clear sections) for complex data.
        Prioritize information that would be expensive to regenerate or re-research."""
