   - Hypothesis formation and testing

3. **Execution Capabilities**
   - File system operations with intelligent code editing
   - Command line execution in a secure environment
   - Advanced web interaction and browser automation
   - Task finalization and reporting
   - Specialized capabilities for various modalities (Experimental) (PDF, audio, image, video, slides)
   - Deep research integration

4. **Context Management**
   - Token usage estimation and optimization
   - Strategic truncation for lengthy interactions
   - File-based archival for large outputs

5. **Real-time Communication**
   - WebSocket-based interface for interactive use
   - Isolated agent instances per client
   - Streaming operational events for responsive UX

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

## Requirements
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- At least one of the following:
  - Anthropic API key, or
  - Google Gemini API key, or  
  - Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled

## Environment

You need to set up 2 `.env` files to run both frontend and backend

### Frontend Environment Variables

For the frontend, create a `.env` file in the frontend directory, point to the port of your backend:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Backend Environment Variables

For the back end, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables. Here are the required variables needed to run this project:

```bash
# Required API Keys - Choose one based on your LLM provider:
# Option 1: For Claude models via Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Option 2: For Gemini models via Google
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
# Search Provider API Key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key

STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/
```

We also support other search and crawl provider such as FireCrawl and SerpAPI (Optional but yield better performance):
```bash
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key 
```

Enabling Image and Video Generation Tool (Optional, good for more creative output)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OPENAI_AZURE_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
```

Image Search Tool  (Optional, good for more beautiful output)
```
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key 
```


## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the 2 environment files as mentioned in the above step
3. If you are using Anthropic Client run
```
chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
./start.sh 
```
If you are using Vertex, run with these variables
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=absolute-path-to-credential \
PROJECT_ID=project-id \
REGION=region \
./start.sh
```
*Note: Due to a bug in the latest docker, if you receive and error, try running with `--force-recreate`. For example `./start.sh --force-recreate `*

After running start.sh, you can check your application at: localhost:3000

Run `./stop.sh` to tear down the service.

### Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Set up frontend (optional):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Command Line Interface

If you want to use anthropic client, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` file and run:
```bash
python cli.py 
```

If you want to use vertex, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and run:
```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path-to-your-credential
python cli.py --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region YOUR_REGION
```

Options:
- `--project-id`: Google Cloud project ID
- `--region`: Google Cloud region (e.g., us-east5)
- `--workspace`: Path to the workspace directory (default: ./workspace)
- `--needs-permission`: Require permission before executing commands
- `--minimize-stdout-logs`: Reduce the amount of logs printed to stdout

### Web Interface

1. Start the WebSocket server:

When using Anthropic client:
```bash
python ws_server.py --port 8000
```

When using Vertex:
```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path-to-your-credential \
python ws_server.py --port 8000 --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --region YOUR_REGION
```

2. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Conclusion

The II-Agent framework, architected around the reasoning capabilities of large language models like Claude 4.0 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Pro, presents a comprehensive and robust methodology for building versatile AI agents. Through its synergistic combination of a powerful LLM, a rich set of execution capabilities, an explicit mechanism for planning and reflection, and intelligent context management strategies, II-Agent is well-equipped to address a wide spectrum of complex, multi-step tasks. Its open-source nature and extensible design provide a strong foundation for continued research and development in the rapidly evolving field of agentic AI.
